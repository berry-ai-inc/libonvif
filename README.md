## Introduction

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>
&nbsp;

Onvif GUI is an integrated camera management system with an intuitive user interface that can be easily installed and configured on a wide variety of hardware, including Windows, Mac and Linux. Built in AI can accurately detect objects of interest and raise alarms to alert users and start recording high resolution streams to disk for archive.

The system is designed to scale with available hardware and will run on simple configurations as well as high end systems for maximum performance. Onvif GUI can be arranged in a client server configuration where a host computer can manage connections to a group of cameras which are isolated from the rest of the network for improved security. Any number of client computers can then be used to observe the streams and receive alarms generated by the server. In such a scenario, the compute load is concentrated on the server, and lower powered computers can be used as observation stations.

The system has integrated OpenVINO support for AI analysis on iGPU Intel hardware. It also will support Apple Silicon NPU AI, enabling high performance in low power environments. This allows users to select the level of hardware appropriate for their application. Apple M4 Mac Mini makes an excellent choice for low to medium power configurations such as a server managing 12 cameras, for example. Intel Ultra Core series chips are also an excellent choice for a Windows based server managing a similar load. For maximum performance, a Linux server equipped with an NVIDIA GPU can be utilized to process data from a large fleet of cameras. 

The system can be configured with auto start settings and a user friendly icon so that non-technical users can feel comfortable working with the application without specialized training. File management is easy with an automated disk space manager and file playback controls. Multiple camera streams can be viewed in the display with a double click action to open a pop up window for displaying a high resolution stream for detailed viewing. Groups of cameras can be bundled together in different windows for display on multiple monitors from a single host computer.

Here is the application running 12 cameras on an Intel NUC with an i7 1360P acting as a host with the yolox detector using OpenVINO on the iGPU in Linux. The application has been configured to display the low resolution camera substreams in the main display on the right and the secondary window on the lower left is showing the high resolution display for a single camera as selected by double clicking the main display on the camera of interest. On the upper left is a separate system monitor application showing the compute load.

<summary>Recommended Configuration</summary>

&nbsp;

For maximum performance, the client-server configuration is recommended. In this configuration, Onvif GUI uses [MediaMTX](https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx) as a proxy server that will buffer the camera streams, providing a consistent low latency interface to the rest of the network. Additionally, this configuration isolates the cameras, blocking all traffic between the cameras and the internet. Isolating cameras on a private subnet may require installing a DHCP server on the Onvif GUI host for ip address assignments. Additionally, the Onvif GUI host can be configured as a file server using Samba or NFS so that clients have access to camera recordings as well. Please refer to the Notes section of this document for details on these additional configurations.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

It is not recommended to use a wireless connection for the server interface in most instances. Wireless cameras are not recommended. A 1 Gb network interface on the server should be sufficient to host a reasonable number of cameras. Wired network connections will result in a more stable and performant experience than wireless connections. Wireless connection stability can also vary widely depending on hardware and drivers. Recent Apple Silicon Mac computers had a noticeably better WiFi experience and are recommended if a wireless connection is required. 

Mac computers with recent M4 chips provide excellent performance. If driving multiple monitors using high resolution streams is a system requirement, the Mac Mini M4 offers high performance with low power consumption, low noise and great value.

Linux computers with a discrete GPU offer very good performance. GPU cards with PCIe 4 compatibility will outperform those designed for PCIe 3. GPU cards with 16 PCIe lanes will outperform those with only 8 lanes. A Linux computer with an integrated GPU, such as a NUC can also provide very good performance, but do have limitations. These Linux configurations are capable of driving multiple monitors but may require some patience when setting up.

Windows computers will work well, but do require more computing power to achieve similar results to Linux systems with less capable hardware. If Windows is the intended OS for either host or client, a higher powered computer will be necessary for satisfactory results. Lower powered computers will run the software but will be limited to running a few streams in low resolution.

## Operation

<details>
<summary>Getting Started</summary>

&nbsp;

<image src="onvif-gui/onvif_gui/resources/discover.png">

Discover

To get started, click the Discover button. A login screen will appear for each camera as it is found. The Settings tab may be used to set a default login that can be used to automatically submit login credentials to cameras. There is also an Auto Discover check box on the Settings panel.

Initially, cameras will populate the list using the default name provided by the manufacturer. To change the camera name, use the F2 key, or the right click context menu over the camera list.

<image src="onvif-gui/onvif_gui/resources/play.png">

Play

Upon completion of discovery, the camera list will be populated. A single click on a camera in the list will display the camera parameters in the lower part of the tab. Double clicking will start the camera output stream. The camera stream may also be started by clicking the play button or by typing the enter key while a camera is highlighted in the list.

Multiple cameras can stream simultaneously. The application will add camera output to the display for each camera as it is started. The controls for camera operations apply to the current camera, which is the highlighted camera in the list on the camera panel. The current camera will have a thin white border around it in the display.

Network conditions, compute load or internal camera issues may cause buffer overflow in the application pipeline. The result may be that packets are dropped, which can degrade the quality of the stream. If packets are being dropped, the camera display will show a yellow border.

<image src="onvif-gui/onvif_gui/resources/stop.png">

Stop

When the camera stream is running, the play button for that camera will change appearance to the stop icon. Clicking the button will stop the stream.  The stream can also be stopped from the camera list by double clicking or typing the enter key.

<image src="onvif-gui/onvif_gui/resources/record.png">

Record

Recording can be initiated manually by clicking the record button. The file name is generated automatically and is based on the start time of the recording in date format as YYYYMMDDmmSS.mp4. The Archive Directory setting will determine the location of the file. A subdirectory is created for each camera to help organize files within the archive.

During manually initiated recording, a rotating red colored tick mark will show in the lower right corner of the stream display. The Record Button on the Camera Panel will show red during all recording operations. Note that recording initiated automatically during Alarm conditions or Record Always will disable the Record Button. 

Files created by the application are limited in length to 15 minutes. Recordings that require a longer time will be broken up into several parts that are each 15 minutes long. There will be a slight overlap between files broken up this way corresponding to the length of the Pre Record Buffer setting.

<image src="onvif-gui/onvif_gui/resources/apply.png">

Apply

Camera parameters are available on the tabs on the lower right side of the application. Initially, the Apply button will be disabled with a dimmed icon. Once a parameter has been changed, the Apply button will be enabled, which can be used to commit the change to the camera. The camera may re-start the stream in order to make the changes.

<image src="onvif-gui/onvif_gui/resources/audio.png">

Mute

Camera audio can be controlled from the panel. The mute button can be clicked to mute the audio. The mute button appearance indicates the state of the audio. The volume slider can be used to control the volume. Note that the mute and volume controls are applied to each camera individually.

<image src="assets/images/media_tab.png" width="400"/>

&nbsp;

* ### W x H (Resolution)

    Camera resolution is adjusted using the combo box which has available settings. To change the camera resolution, make a selection from the combo box and then click the apply button. The camera may re-start the video stream in order to effect the change.

* ### Aspect

    When using substreams, the aspect ratio may be distorted. Changing the aspect ratio by using the combo box can restore the correct appearance of the video. If the aspect ratio has been changed this way, the label of the box will have a * appended. This setting is not native to the camera, so it is not necessary to click the apply button for this change.

* ### FPS

    Frame rate of the camera can be adjusted using the spin box. The change is made on the camera when the apply button is clicked. Higher frame rates will have a better appearance with smoother motion at the expense of increased compute load.

* ### GOP

    Keyframe interval of the video stream. Keyframes are a full frame encoding, whereas intermediate frames are differential representations of the changes between frames.  Keyframes are larger and require more computing power to process. Higher GOP intervals mean fewer keyframes and as a  result, less accurate representation of the video.  Lower GOP rates increase the accuracy of the  video at the expense of higher bandwidth and compute load. It is necessary to click the Apply button to enact these changes on the camera.

    Note that some cameras may have an option for Dynamic GOP or Adaptive Framerate, or some other name for a process that reduces the GOP automatically based on the lack of motion in the camera view. It is advised to turn this feature off when using onvif-gui. To access the feature, use the camera web application from the System Tab -> Browser button.

* ### Bitrate

    The bitrate of the video stream. Higher bitrates increase the quality of the video appearance at the expense of larger file sizes. This is most relevant when maintaining recordings of videos on the host file system. Bitrates are generally expressed in kbps by cameras, but may be inaccurate or scaled differently.  Use the Apply button after changing this setting to enact the change on the camera.

* ### Profile

    Most cameras are capable of producing multiple media streams. This feature can be useful when running many cameras on the same computer or if a compute intensive task is being run on a stream. The default stream of the camera is called the Main Stream. A secondary stream running at lower settings is called the Sub Stream. The application uses the terms Display Profile and Record Profile to describe these settings.

    Initially, the Main Stream is selected by default as both the Display Profile and the Record Profile. By changing the selection to a secondary profile on the Media Tab, a lower order Sub Stream can be displayed. The term lower order implies that the Sub Stream has lower resolution, lower frame rate and lower bitrate than the Main Stream. Note that the application may be processing both streams, but only the Display Profile selected on the Video Tab is displayed. The other stream, referred to as the Record Stream, is not decoded, but its packets are collected for writing to disk storage.

    The display will update automatically when the Video Tab Profile combo box is changed, so it is not necessary to click the Apply button when changing this setting.

* ### No Audio

    Audio can be disabled by selecting this check box. This is different than mute in the sense that under mute, the audio stream is decoded, but not played on the computer speakers. If the No Audio check box is selected, the audio stream is discarded. If the No Audio checkbox is deselected, the stream will restart in order to initialize the audio. The Apply button is not clicked when changing this parameter. This checkbox is selected by default.

    <b>** Please Note **</b> If the audio is enabled by deselecting this check box, and there is no physical audio device connected to the computer, there may be issues with stream processing. If an Audio Driver is specified on the Settings -> General panel such as pulseaudio, there should be a physical audio device such as headphones, speakers or HDMI connected to the host computer. Without a physical device, it may be possible in some cases for the audio driver to enter an undefined state which may cause the camera stream to stutter or freeze and may lead to lengthy timeouts when closing the camera stream. If there is no physical device available, the Audio Driver can be changed to dummy in order to avoid this problem. This condition applies only to camera streams which are displayed to the user interface. The Record Stream, if different than the Display Stream, is hidden and is not affected by this condition.

* ### Audio

    The audio encoder used by the camera is set here.  If the camera does not have audio capability, the audio section will be disabled. Note that some cameras may have audio capability, but the stream is not available due to configuration issues or lack of hardware accessories.  Available audio encoders will be shown in the combo box and may be set by the user. Changes to the audio parameter require that the Apply button is clicked to enact the change on the camera.
    
    AAC encoding is a higher quality stream and are recommended for recording. G711 style encoders are good for low latency playback if real time operation is important. Streams using AAC encoding map to mp4 file format and G711 uses mov. Note that some cameras have incorrect implementations for encoders and the audio may not be usable in the stream recording to disk. Please be aware that currently onvif-gui is unable to process G726.

* ### Samples

    Available sample sizes are shown in the combo box. Use the Apply button to enact the change on the camera.  Higher sample sizes increase the quality of the audio at the expense of higher bandwidth and disk space when recording. Lower sample sizes correlate to lower latency. The audio bitrate is implied by the sample size based on encoder parameters.

* ### Video Alarm

    This check box enables video analytic processing for alarm generation. See the section on Video Panel for reference to video alarm functions.  Note that the Video Alarm check box must be selected in order to enable the Video Panel for that camera. The Apply button is not used for this setting. During Alarm condition, a solid red circle will show in the stream display if not recording, or a blinking red circle if the stream is being recorded.

* ### Audio Alarm
 
    This check box enables audio analytic processing for alarm generation. See the section on Audio Panel for reference to audio alarm functions.  Note that the Audio Alarm check box must be selected in order to enable the Audio Panel for that camera. The Apply button is not used for this box. During Alarm condition, a solid red circle will show in the stream display if not recording, or a blinking red circle if the stream is being recorded.

* ### Snapshot

    This button will write a jpeg file of the current camera screen to the directory specified on the Settings Panel.

If the DHCP is enabled, all fields are set by the server, if DHCP is disabled, other network settings may be completed manually. Note that IP setting changes may cause the camera to be inaccessible if using cached addresses. Use the Discover button to find the camera, or enter the new address manually from the settings panel.

Take care when changing these settings, the program does not check for errors and it maybe possible to set the camera into an unreachable configuration. 

The Apply button must be clicked to enact any of these changes on the camera.

* ### Recording

    The check box at the top of the Record group box will enable automatic recording of camera streams when selected. The Record Profile combo box below will select the camera profile to be recorded.
    
    If the Record Alarms radio button is selected, the application will record automatically during alarm condition. While the stream is being recorded during alarm condition, there will be a blinking red circle in the lower right corner of the stream display. File sizes are limited to 15 minute lengths, so multiple files will be created if the alarm condition lasts longer than this limit.

    Selecting the Record Always radio button will cause the application to record the camera at all times that it is streaming. The files are written to disk in 15 minute file lengths, and are named in a time format representing the start time of the recording. Unlike other recording modes, the Record Always condition does not display an indicator in the stream display.

    It not necessary to use the Apply button for any of the settings on this panel.

* ### Alarm Sounds

    The check box at the top of the Sounds group box will enable alarm sounds on the computer speaker when checked.  If the Loop radio button is selected, the sound will play continuously during an alarm condition.  Selection of the Once radio button will cause the application to play the alarm sound once per alarm condition.

* ### Record Profile

    The drop down box can be used to the select the camera profile that will be recorded to disk. The Record Profile can be different than the Display Profile shown in the application. This setting can be used most effectively when the application is configured to show the low resolution substream profile in the display, and use the high resolution main profile as the recording source. This enables the application to maintain real time display status, especially with multiple streams, while preserving high resolution accuracy in the recorded stream. Because the recorded stream in not decoded, but rather is piped directly from the camera to disk, the high resolution recording presents very little compute load on the host.

* ### Record Audio

    In many cases, the audio of the Display Profile will be disabled. By default, audio is disabled for camera streams. This is particulaly relevant when displaying multiple streams, as the audio from multiple cameras playing simultaneously may cause confusion. This checkbox allows the display audio to be disabled while preserving audio on the recorded stream.  

* ### Reboot

    Click to reboot the camera.

* ### Browser

    This will launch the web browser and connect to the camera.  Cameras will have a web interface that can be used to set parameters that are not available to the application.

* ### Sync Time

    Clicking the Sync Time button will bring up a dialog box with time settings options for the camera.

    &nbsp;

    <image src="assets/images/sync_time.png" width="640">

    &nbsp;

    At the top of the dialog are boxes showing the current settings for computer time and camera time respectively. The camera time is calculated based on the time offset parameter used by the computer for authentication. This time should, but may not necessarily, closely match the time displayed by the camera in the video stream. Variations in how cameras compute time may result in an offset mismatch between the time displayed in the camera video stream and the computed time shown on the dialog.

    The Time Zone and Daylight Savings Time fields can be edited by the user and set in the camera for configuration. 
    
    The Time Zone format can vary and different cameras will accept different formats. The long format shown in the example resembles POSIX standard and is the most comprehensive format which includes time offset from UTC and DST offset with DST start and finish parameters. Most cameras do not conform entirely to this standard, but may accept the string while selectively ignoring portions of the configuration. The most widely accepted form is UTC format or alternately, GMT format both of which have an optional +/- sign and hour plus optional minute offsets delimited by colon. Examples might be UTC0 or UTC-04:00. The GMT format is the same, but note that the polarity of the sign is reversed e.g. GMT0 or GMT+04:00. Other formats may possibly work e.g. EST5EDT, which may be worth trying.

    The Daylight Savings Time checkbox can be edited by the user, or it may be set automatically by the camera depending on the camera abilities. Not all cameras support DST, and some may save the DST flag but not act on the information when computing time.

    The Time Sync Method group box selects the time adjustment strategy used by the application.

    NTP Time setting will enable the NTP server box to allow editing. There are three types of server configuration. From DHCP will instruct the camera to use the NTP server data from the most recent DHCP configuration. This may or may not be the server data from the DHCP. In many cases, this will be a hardcoded address in the camera firmware. IPv4 address will use a numeric style IP address for the NTP server. A failure of this parameter configuration may or may not produce an error message from the camera. A Domain Name style server configuration will use a dot notation server name similar to a web address and will require proper DNS configuration for resolution. Once configured, the camera will use the Time Zone and DST information it has stored in its settings to deduce its time from the NTP server response to the camera query. In all cases, if the NTP server address is located on the internet the camera will require internet access in order to contact the server.

    Manual Time Setting will use the computer hosting the application to derive the time sent to the camera. The computer will send a UTC time to the camera and the camera will calculate its time based on the Time Zone and DST information that it has in its settings.

    UTC as Local setting is a specific type of manual setting that will force the camera into displaying the same time as the computer host. This is done by setting the camera Time Zone to UTC0 and setting the time on the camera to match the application computer host time. As UTC time is not dependent on DST, issues associated with DST can be ignored. If the computer time is accurate and regularly updated, this can be a good strategy for many cameras, as it circumvents a lot of ambiguity in time setting configurations which may be inaccurate or outdated. Note that some cameras, if connected to the internet, may eventually resort to hidden NTP settings that will reset the camera time (often incorrectly) if this strategy is employed. If a camera is using this type of NTP access, it is advisable to isolate it from the internet as a security precaution. If this is not practical or desired, the time zone and DST settings can be used such that the camera perhaps might display the correct time.

    Ultimately, there are many variations and inconsistencies when dealing with camera times. In most cases, UTC as Local with cameras isolated from the internet will provide the best results. Camera algorithms for time setting are often opaque and in many cases incomplete or incorrect. Cameras with proper time setting implementations can be set using the Time Zone and DST settings, but should be verified for accuracy and completeness, especially regarding DST. NTP use is discouraged, as cameras should be isolated from the internet as a security precaution. Using an NTP server on the internal network does not provide any advantage over Manual time setting via the application host computer.

<summary>File Operations</summary>
&nbsp;

<i>Camera recordings can be viewed from within the application. A playback can be viewed alongside running cameras or in a separate window. Files can be searched for a particular moment in time. A server can share recordings using Samba or NFS so that clients can view previously recorded streams.</i>

---

&nbsp;

The application maintains a folder for the storage of camera recordings. The folder by default is the OS video storage location, and can be changed using the directory setting at the top of the panel. There is a subfolder for each camera that has previously made recordings in the application. If you are using Onvif GUI as a client, and the server is configured to share files using either Samba or NFS, you can use the shared server folder to access recordings made on the server by navigating with the three dot button. Inside the camera folders are the individual files recorded by the camera. The files are named using a datetime convention which represents the start time of the recording. The recording is prepended in the front by a time interval specified on the Settings -> Alarm panel as Pre-Alarm Buffer Size. The file creation time in the OS represents the end time of the file, which occurs as a result of the file being committed to disk at the conclusion of the recording process.

Please note that the initial appearance of the file panel may not display all file info fields, hence the scroll bar at the bottom of the file list. The view can be expanded dragging from left side of the file list panel. For convenience, it is possible to set up a window profile in Settings -> General-> Open New Window for viewing files and expand the file list panel, which will preserve the size of the panel for future use. It is also possible to hide the camera panel so that the file viewer window will open directly into the file panel.

&nbsp;

<image src="assets/images/file_panel.png" width="500">

&nbsp;

File playback is configured such that one file is played at a time. Keyboard shortcuts are available for faster navigation. A file may be played along side cameras in the main display if desired, or a separate window profile can be configure on the Settings -> General tab for file viewing. The Hide Camera Panel check box can be useful for this separate window profile for file viewing.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Keyboard shortcuts are available when the file list of the File Panel has the application focus. A single click on any file or folder in the list will achieve this focus. Keyboard operations may be significantly faster than using the mouse when browsing through files.

* <h3>Enter</h3>

  The Enter key can be used to Play the file. Note that if another file is currently playing, it will be stopped before the new file starts.

* <h3>Space</h3>

  The space bar can be used to Pause the current file playing.
    
* <h3>Escape</h3>

  The Escape key can be used to stop the current file playing.
    
* <h3>Delete</h3>

  Files may be deleted by typing the Delete key. Multiple files may be deleted simultaneously by selecting multiple files using the Shift or Control keys while selecting.

* <h3>F1</h3>

  The F1 key will show a dialog with file properties.
    
* <h3>F2</h3>

  Files can be renamed using the F2 key.
    
* <h3>Right Arrow</h3>

  The Right Arrow will fast forward the file playing by 10 seconds.
    
* <h3>Left Arrow</h3>

  The Left Arrow will rewind the file playing by 10 seconds.

* <h3>Up Arrow</h3>

  The Up Arrow will move to the previous file without stopping the current file. Use the Enter key to start playing the newly highlighted file.

* <h3>Down Arrow</h3>

  The Down Arrow will move to the next file without stopping the current file. Use the Enter key to start playing the newly highlighted file.

### Progress / Seek Indicator

The File Panel has a progress bar that will show the state of the playback. The total duration of the file is shown on the right hand side of the progress bar, and the left hand side will show the current file position which is indicated by the progress bar handle. If the mouse hovers over the bar, the position within the file will be shown above. The seek function will set the file position to the mouse location if the mouse is clicked on the progress bar. Sliding operation is not supported.

### Pop Up Menu

Right clicking over the file will bring up a context menu that can be used to perform file operations.

### Hide Camera Panel

Viewing files may be more convenient if a separate window is set up distinct from the camera display. This can be helpful if viewing archived recordings while cameras are being displayed in real time. A file view can be created from the Settings -> General tab using the three dot button in the Open New Window section. Once the file viewer is set up, the Hide Camera Panel checkbox can be selected so that only files and not cameras are shown on the file view window. Additionally, it may be helpful to expand the right side of the application to accomodate the full file parameter display tab. These settings will be preserved on the file viewer window and will not affect the default window started by the application.

### File Searching by Time

The application has the ability to search the files by camera for a particular moment in time.

&nbsp;

<image src="assets/images/file_search.png">

&nbsp;

The search dialog is launched by clicking the search icon on the File panel. Use the dialog box to select a Camera, Date and Time and the application will search the files for that particular moment. If found, a confirmation box will pop up and the file can be played directly. The application will automatically highlight the file in the list and forward the playback to a moment near the selected time. There may be a slight offset corresponding roughly to the Pre-Alarm Buffer Size from the Settings -> Alarm panel.

If the application was not able to find the exact match, a pop up box will ask if you want to play the closest file in time. Note that the application will highlight this closest match in the file list, so you could use that as a starting point for navigating through the files.

### Refresh File View

The files listed in the panel my not be updated automatically. Use the refresh icon to get a current listing of the files available for view.


### Event Browser

  If the Save Picture for Alarms checkbox on the Settings -> Alarm panel is selected (yes by default), the system will save a picture each time an alarm is triggered. Clicking the Events button on the file panel will pop up the Event Browser dialog which can be used to view the pictures.

  &nbsp;

  <image src="assets/images/event_browser.png" width="640">

  &nbsp;

  The pictures are shown as the current selection on the list changes. Double clicking, typing the Enter key or clicking the View button will start the video associated with the event at the time point of the occurrence of the event.

&nbsp;

### Common Username and Password

Default camera login credentials. If there is a camera on the list that does not share these credentials, a pop up login box will appear during discovery. It is possible to add these alternate credentials into the stored profile of the camera by right clicking over the camera in the list and selecting the password option, which will silently add the credentials to the stored settings so that the camera can be discovered without having to type in the credentials.

### Hardware Decoder

A hardware decoder may be selected for the application. Multicore CPUs with more than a few cores will handle the decoding just as easily as a hardware decoder. Smaller CPUs with a small number of cores may benefit from hardware decoding. VAAPI and VDPAU pertain to Linux systems and DXVA2 and D3D11VA are for Windows. CUDA decoding is platform independent and requires NVIDIA GPU.

### Start Full Screen

Selecting this check box will cause the application to start in full screen mode. The full screen mode can be cancelled with the Escape key. The F12 key will also toggle full screen mode.

### Auto Time Sync

This selection will send a time sync message to each of the cameras once an hour. The camera time is set according to the parameters defined in the Sync Time dialog box described in Camera Parameters shown above.

### Display Refresh Interval

Performance on some lower powered systems may be improved by increasing the display refresh interval.

### Maximum Input Stream Cache Size

Adjust the maximum number of frames held in the cache before frames are dropped. This is the same cache referred to by the Video Tab of the Camera Panel.

### Open New Window

Manage profiles for secondary windows used to display a camera or a group of cameras separately from the main application window.

The default 'Reader' profile is a reserved profile that launches a specialized secondary File panel browser that can operate with it's own configuration for viewing files. The secondary File panel can be used during camera operation without interferring with the main program.

The default 'Focus' profile is a reserved profile that is integrated into application logic. The Focus Window can be launched by double clicking on a camera stream in the main display and can show that camera at higher resolution and frame rate for a more detailed view. The Focus Window will show only one camera at a time. The application will automatically configure the Focus settings for proxy type and auto discovery.

Additional profiles can be added using the three dot button to the right of the drop down box that will launch a configuration dialog box.

&nbsp;

<image src="assets/images/profile.png" width="360">

&nbsp;

New Windows can be configured to show specific groups of cameras, which can be useful if the host computer is driving several monitors such that different groups of cameras are shown on different monitors. The Open button will launch a window with the profile selected in the drop down box. Each profile will have a separate configuration that is set by the user.

It may be useful to create a profile excusively for viewing camera recordings from the File tab. This way the window can be configured with a larger navigation panel showing more complete file information. Additionally, the camera panel can be hidden in this profile so that the window opens directly to the file list.

### Start All / Close All

This button will change appearance depending on whether there are streams playing or not. It can be used to batch control cameras to start or stop as a group. It will start all cameras on the Camera List. It will stop all streams, including files if playing.

### Show Logs

This button will show the logs of the application. Many events and errors encountered will be documented here. The log rolls over at 1 MB. The older logs can be managed using the Archive button on the logs display dialog.

### Help

Shows this file.

### Hide Display

If running Onvif GUI in server configuration, it may be desirable to run in headless mode. If this is the case, hiding the display will significantly reduce compute load by bypassing the rendering routines. In this configuration, the compute load will be similar to that of a console application. Once the display is hidden, the text of the button will change to Show Display with appropriate functionality.


## Discover Settings

&nbsp;

<image src="assets/images/discover.png" width="400">

&nbsp;

### Discovery Options

* Discovery Broadcast

  This option will broadcast a discovery packet to find cameras on the local network. If the host computer is attached to multiple networks it is possible to broadcast across all networks or only one selected network. Cameras discovered will have their data entered into the address cache so that they may be found without discovery later.

* Cached Addresses

  This option will cause the application to find cameras based on the cache data rather than the discovery broadcast. Note that cameras may be deleted from the cache by using the Delete key or the right click context menu on the camera list. This can be useful if a subset of cameras on the network is going to be streamed. Note that some cameras may respond with incomplete data when using a cached address.

* Add Camera

  It is possible to add a camera manually to the address cache by using the Add Camera button. The IP address and ONVIF port are required to connect.  The ONVIF port by default is 80. If successful, the camera will be added silently to the camera list. If a camera is added manually using this method, it will not persist in the interface unless the Cached Addresses option is selected.

### Auto Discovery

When selected, this option will cause the application to discover cameras automatically when it starts. This holds true whether the application is using Broadcast Discovery or Cached Addresses.  Note that if this option is selected and the Broadcast Discovery Option is also selected, the application will poll the network once per minute to find missing or new cameras.

### Auto Start

When selected in combination with the Auto Discovery check box, cameras shown in the list will start automatically when the application starts. This feature will work with either Discovery Broadcast or Cached Addresses.

## Storage Settings

&nbsp;

<image src="assets/images/storage.png" width="400">

&nbsp;

### Disk Usage

The application has the ability to manage the disk space used by the recorded media files. This setting is recommended as the files can overwhelm the computer and cause the application to crash. Allocating a directory for the camera recordings is done by assigning a directory using the Archive Dir selection widget. The default setting for the Archive Dir is the user's Video directory. It is advised to change this setting if the host computer employs the user's Video directory for other applications.

* Current Disk Usage

  When the application starts, or a new file is created for a camera recording, the approximate amount of disk space used by the application is displayed. This number is not exact, but can give a general idea of the amount of disk space used.

* Auto Manage Checkbox

  Select this check box to enable disk management.  A warning dialog will inform the user of the risk of the loss of files within the directory. Note that the application will only delete files that conform to the date style file naming convention that it uses. It is a good idea to use a directory that can be dedicated exclusively to the application.

  The maximum available disk space that could be allocated to the application based on the Archive Dir setting will be displayed next to the checkbox.

  The spin box can be used to limit the application disk usage in GB. Note that the application is conservative in it's estimate of required file size and the actual space occupied by the media files will be a few GB less than the allocated space.

## Proxy Settings

&nbsp;

<image src="assets/images/proxy.png" width="400">

&nbsp;

## Proxy Type

* Stand Alone

  Default setting, implements a single instance of the program that connects to the cameras directly.

* Client

  The application will act as a client to the proxy server using a connection string corresponding to one displayed by the server in the url box. If the connection string is changed, the Update button must be clicked to enact the changes. If the server is capable of generating detections, they can be received or ignored by the client using the 'Get alarm events from server' checkbox. If the server detections are not enabled, the client may generate detections locally if desired.

  If the server detections are enabled, the application will look for the interface that matches the subnet of the server. If the server address has been entered incorrectly, this condition will prompt an error message and the event listener will not be instantiated.

* Server
  
  The application will host a proxy server and allow other instances of the application configured as clients to connect over the local network to the cameras proxied by the server. The server backend is provided by [Media MTX](https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx). The application will download the appropriate binary executable file from the developer github page and copy it to the python environment bin folder. If you prefer to use your own Media MTX binary, the location can be set with the directory control.

  Alarm broadcasting by the server can be controlled using the 'Alarm Broadcasting' group box. This function will broadcast a single UDP packet containing the alarm states for all cameras on the server at an interval of once per second. The UDP packet can be received by any machine on the broadcast network.
  
  For server hosts running Windows, broadcasting is limited to the network with the highest priority. The Network combo box in this case will have only one entry which corresponds to the highest priority network. Please see the section in Notes -> Network Priority on Multi Homed Hosts to view instructions on how to set network priority. Linux and Mac OS hosts are able to select the network on which to broadcast alarms.

## Alarm Settings

&nbsp;

<image src="assets/images/alarm.png" width="400">

&nbsp;

### Pre-Alarm Buffer Size

When a camera is recording, this length of media is prepended to the file so that the moments prior to the alarm are preserved. If always recording, or the file length is limited by the system to 15 minutes, this feature will insure that there is a small overlap between adjacent files.

### Post-Alarm Lag Time

In the case where a camera is configured to record during alarms, this length of time must pass after the cessation of the alarm before the file recording is turned off.  This helps to prevent excessive file creation.

### Alarm Sounds

A few default alarm sounds for selection.  A system wide volume setting for the alarm volume can be made with the slider.

### Show Alarms on Display

When selected (default is yes) a red filled circle will be displayed on the camera stream during alarm conditions. The circle will blink if the stream is being recorded during an alarm. De-selecting this checkbox will show the camera stream without any alarm markings.

### Save Picture for Alarms

When selected (default is yes) a picture will be saved to the Pictures directory each time an alarm is triggered. The pictures are used to populate the Event Browser accessible from the File panel which can be used to view vidoes at the time point of the alarm.

<summary>Video Panel</summary>
&nbsp;

<i>Video streams cam be analyzed to generate alarms.</i>

---

The Video Panel has multiple modes of operation. The default setting is for motion, which can be used without further configuration and will run easily on a CPU only computer. YOLOX requires the installation of additional python packages, namely pytorch and openvino. YOLOX will perform well on recent Apple Silicon M chips, NVIDIA GPU, and Intel Xe, UHD or ARC Graphics.

In order for the panel to be enabled, either a camera or a file must be selected. If a camera is selected, the Video Alarm check box must also be selected on the Media Tab of the Camera Panel. If a file is selected, the Enable File check box on the Video Panel must be selected.

Parameters set on the panel are applied to files globally, and to cameras individually.

If the analysis produces an alarm, record and alarm sound actions are taken based on the settings made on the System Tab of the Camera Panel. Files are not connected to alarm processing.

<summary><b>Motion Detection</b></summary>
&nbsp;

<i>Motion detection is useful in lower powered systems without AI processing capabilities</i>

---

&nbsp;

<image src="assets/images/motion.png" width="640">

&nbsp;

The motion detector measures the difference between two consecutive frames by calculating the percentage of pixels that have changed. If that result is over a threshold value, an alarm is triggered. The Diff check box will show a visualization of the differential pixel map that is used by the calculation. The status bar will light green to red as the value of the algorithm result increases. The Gain slider can amplify or attenuate the result to adjust the sensitivity of the detector. Higher Gain slider values increase the sensitivity of the detector.

Motion detection systems are prone to false alarms due to the indiscriminate nature of the analysis. They can be useful in settings where motion is limited, such as a controlled indoor environment. They are not recommended for general use, expecially in outdoor settings.

<summary><b>YOLOX</b></summary>
&nbsp;

<i>YOLOX is an AI powered analysis for detecting specific types of objects</i>

---

&nbsp;

<image src="assets/images/yolox.png" width="640">

&nbsp;

<b>Prerequisites</b>

YOLOX will run with hardware acceleration on Apple Silicon, NVIDIA GPU and Intel iGPU, NPU, or ARC Graphics.

<b>Installation Requirements</b>

<b>Please Note:</b>The installation scripts for Linux and Mac OS install the necessary python libraries automatically. The Linux installation scripts will install iGPU drivers on Intel chips automatically. If using NVIDIA GPU, those drivers are usually installed by default on modern Linux distros, but some may require manual installation. Windows users will need to install drivers and python libraries manually for the time being.

<b>Configuration</b>

The upper portion of the yolox panel has a model configuration box. Model parameters are system wide, as there will be one model running that is shared by all cameras. The Name combo box selects the model, which is named according to the size of the number of parameters in the model. Larger models may produce more accurate results at the cost of increased compute load. The Size combo box sets the resolution to which the video is scaled for model input. Larger sizes may increase accuracy at the cost of increased compute load. It is possible to change the backend API of the yolo detector by using the API combo box. The Device combo box will populate automatically with available hardware.

The model is initialized automatically by starting a camera stream with the Camera tab Video Alarm checked. By default the application is configured to download a model automatically when a stream is started for the first time. There may be a delay while the model is downloaded, during which time a wait box is shown. Subsequent stream launches will run the model with less delay.

A model may be specified manually by de-selecting the Automatically download model checkbox and populating the Model file name box. Note that if a model is manually specified, it is still necessary to assign the correct Name corresponding to the model parameter size.

The lower portion of the panel has settings for detector configuration. Parameters on this section are assigned to each camera individually.

Skip Frames spin box sets the number of frames to skip between model analysis runs. If the Skip Frames value is set to zero, every frame produced by stream is set through the detector. If the Skip Frames value is set to one, every other frame is sent through the detector, and so on. This setting can be used to reduce computational burden on the system.

The yolox detector samples a number of frames as set by the Samples setting. The number of frames with positive detections required to trigger an alarm is set by the Limit slider. For example, if the Sample Size is 4 and the Limit slider is set to 2, at least two of the last four frames observed must have positive detections in order to trigger the alarm.

There is also a Confidence slider that applies to the yolox model output. Higher confidence settings require stricter conformance to model expectations to qualify a positive detection. Lower confidence settings will increase the number of detections at the risk of false detections.

It is necessary to assign at least one target to the panel in order to observe detections. The + button will launch a dialog box with a list of the available targets. Targets may be removed by using the - button or the delete key while the target is highlighted in the list.

<summary><b>Ryzen AI (FOR REFERENCE ONLY - NOT WORKING WITH CURRENT API)</b></summary>
&nbsp;

<i>AMD NPU can run YOLOX using the Ryzen AI framework</i>

---

&nbsp;

Source code can be found on [github](https://github.com/sr99622/onvif-gui-ryzen-ai)

yolox will work with RyzenAI on AMD chips with NPU. Configuration Details are available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/amd/yolox-s). The AMD system is still under development, so options here are limited to a single model with fixed parameters, but performance is on par with competing solutions. Configuration for this model requires installation of the Ryzen AI Software which in turn requires anaconda as the python provider. Note as well that the anaconda installation required by this setup needs the anaconda binaries available in the PATH environment variable, which may cause conflicts with other python configurations. 

<b>Installing RyzenAI</b>

Installing the RyzenAI software can be challenging as the instructions are not entirely clear on the procedure. There are four major steps that need to be completed for a successful installation. 

  1.) Visual Studio needs to be installed with the Desktop Development with C++ module. This procedure is fairly well documented by Microsoft, the catch is to install the Desktop C++ module. 
  
  2.) Anaconda needs to be installed with the PATH variable set. There is a selection at the beginning of the Anaconda installation for this option along with a warning that it is not recommended. Please note that this selection has two issues. One is that the PATH setting may interfere with an existing Python installation by overriding the existing Python PATH and may cause other applications to fail. Another issue is the scope of the PATH environment variables setting. If the Anaconda installation is set for User, rather than System, the PATH will be set in the User scope only. The RyzenAI installation will expect the PATH in the System scope. You can recover from this error if encountered by copying the anaconda PATH variables from User to System. The PATH settings are accessed by going to Settings -> System -> About -> Advanced System Settings -> Environment Variables.

  3.) NPU Drivers need to be installed. The drivers are downloaded from the AMD website after a credential assignment requiring account creation. The drivers come in a zip file e.g. RAI_1.3.1_242_WHQL.zip, which should be unpacked. Open a powershell prompt in Administrator mode to run the executable inside the unzipped folder e.g. `.\npu_sw_installer.exe`. Upon completion of the command, use the Device Manager for Windows to find the NPU in the hardware devices list and check that the driver version matches the installation script to verify successful installation.

  4.) Install the Ryzen AI Software. The AI software is implemented as a conda environment which is set up by an installation application. You will need to download the installer from the AMD website using the credentials established previously for the driver download. The file will be an msi, e.g. ryzen-ai-1.3.1.msi. A common mistake is to think that this file is meant to be run by double clicking, as most files of this type would normally be run. Instead, use an Administrator privileged powershell prompt to start the install application, e.g. `.\ryzen-ai-1.3.1.msi`. This will avoid permission errors which are not properly reflected in the error messages. 

<b>Install Onvif GUI in the conda environment</b>

The Onvif GUI application will need to be installed into the anaconda environment generated by the Ryzen AI installation procedure. If you've lost track of the environment name, you can look for it using the command `conda env list`. The environment will have the necessary dependencies installed automatically. Activate the environment, e.g. `conda activate ryzen-ai-1.3.1`, and use the command `pip install onvif-gui` to install the application.

<b>Configure the VAIP</b>

Note as well that the configuration requires the location of the <b>vaip_config.json</b> file generated by the RyzenAI Software installation. This file can usually be found in the RyzenAI home directory which is in the `C:\Program Files\RyzenAI\1.3.1\voe-4.0-win_amd64` folder, where 1.3.1 is the version of the software and can be expected to change with version updates. The model itself will be downloaded automatically from HuggingFace by default, or can be installed manually if preferred.

<summary>Audio Panel</summary>
&nbsp;

<i>AAC Audio streams can be analyzed to generate alarms.</i>

---

The audio panel can analyze streams in both amplitude and frequency domains. Note that frequency analysis requires slightly more computing power than amplitude analysis. Please note that only AAC encoded audio is supported at this time.

In order for the panel to be enabled, either a camera or a file must be selected. If a camera is selected, the Video Alarm check box must also be selected on the Media Tab of the Camera Panel. If a file is selected, the Enable File check box on the Video Panel must also be selected.

Parameters set on the panel are applied to files globally, and to cameras individually.

If the analysis produces an alarm, record and alarm sound actions are taken based on the settings made on the System Tab of the Camera Panel. Files are not connected to alarm processing.


&nbsp;

<image src="assets/images/audio_panel.png" width="400">

&nbsp;

* ### Amplitude

The amplitude is measured by calculating the Root Mean Square (rms) value of the audio waveform. If the rms exceeds threshold, an alarm condition is triggered. The Gain slider can be used to amplify or attenuate the value of the signal in order to adjust the sensitivity of the detector.

* ### Frequency

The frequency spectrum is measured by the integrated area under the spectrum curve normalized. The spectrum may be filtered to eliminate undesired frequencies. Lower frequencies are often common background sounds that do not warrant an alarm condition, whereas higher frequency sounds are often associated with a sudden, sharp noise such as breaking glass.

There are filter bars that can be adjusted using the cursor handles. Frequencies excluded by the filter are depicted in gray. The Gain slider can be used to amplify or attenuate the value of the signal in order to adjust the sensitivity of the detector.

* ### Over/Under

The detector can be configured to alarm in the absence of sound by selecting the Under radio button. This may be useful in situations such as an engine room monitor configured to alarm if the engine stops running. This mode will invert the status bar level.

The application windows can be configured to run in full screen mode. The F12 key is used to toggle full screen. If the application is running full screen, the Escape key can be used to return to windowed operation.

The control tab on the right of the application window may be toggled using the F11 key. On Mac, it is necessary to use the command key + F11 combination to override the default workspace action. The size of the control tab can be changed by dragging the left hand edge of the tab. Reducing the size of the tab beyond it's minimum will hide the tab. If there is at least one stream in the display and the control tab is hidden, clicking on the stream display area will restore the control tab.

<summary>DHCP Servers</summary>

&nbsp;

<i>A network set up as shown in the Recommended Configuration will require some mechanism for setting IP addresses to the cameras and computers that connect to the network. Although this may be achieved by setting  static IP for each device, a DHCP server is recommended. This is a service that is installed on the Onvif GUI server host computer. DHCP service configuration details are shown for each operating system.</i>

<details>
<summary>Linux</summary>

&nbsp;

Linux can be configured to run a kea [DHCP server](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/how-to-install-and-configure-isc-kea). A sample configuration file `/etc/kea/kea-dhcp4.conf` for this server is shown below.

It is necessary to set the server ethernet interface to a static IP address for this configuration. It is recommended to manually set the Onvif GUI server ethernet address connecting to the camera network to be 10.1.1.1. This is a reserved network for private subnets. Please verify that your existing network does not use this address range. There are many references that can provide details on how to set a static ip. On Ubuntu, use the Settings -> Network -> Wired Network then click on the gear to get details, use the IPv4 tab and click the Manual radio button  to enable manual settings. The IP address should be set to `10.1.1.1`, the Subnet Mask to `255.255.255.0` and the Gateway to `10.1.1.1`. If you need internet access, you should have a second network connection to your local router, which is configured separately.

It will be necessary to find the name of the network interface intended to provide the DHCP service. On Linux, the command `ip a` will provide a listing of interface properties that will contain the relevant information. It will look something like `enp1s0` but will be different for each machine. The name will be associated with the ip address (<i>10.1.1.1 as set previously</i>) of the desired interface.

### Sample Configuration File

```
{
  "Dhcp4": {
    "interfaces-config": {
    "interfaces": [ "<your-interface-name>" ]
    },
    "control-socket": {
        "socket-type": "unix",
        "socket-name": "/run/kea/kea4-ctrl-socket"
    },
    "lease-database": {
        "type": "memfile",
        "lfc-interval": 3600
    },
    "valid-lifetime": 600,
    "max-valid-lifetime": 7200,
    "subnet4": [
    {
        "id": 1,
        "subnet": "10.1.1.0/24",
        "pools": [
        {
            "pool": "10.1.1.64 - 10.1.1.242"
        }
        ],
        "option-data": [
        {
            "name": "routers",
            "data": "10.1.1.1"
        },
        {
            "name": "domain-name-servers",
            "data": "10.1.1.1"
        },
        {
            "name": "domain-name",
            "data": "mydomain.example"
        }
        ]
    }
    ]
  }
}
```

This is a basic configuration that will assign addresses in the range of 10.1.1.64 - 10.1.1.242, leaving the balance of addresses available for static ip. The router and name server addresses point back to the server, which is a dead end. This means that there is no direct traffic between the cameras and the internet or the rest of the network. All communication with the cameras is proxied by the Onvif GUI server.

The service can be set up by copying the sample file to `/etc/kea/kea-dhcp4.conf`, replacing the tag `<your-interface-name>` with the appropriate data from the `ip a` command,  This can be done using the command `sudo nano /etc/kea/kea-dhcp4.conf`, then copying the text above and using ctrl+O, enter, ctrl+X to save and exit.

Use the commands shown below to control the service. Be sure to use the enable command to get persistent service operation through reboots.

```
sudo systemctl enable kea-dhcp4-server
sudo systemctl disable kea-dhcp4-server
sudo systemctl start kea-dhcp4-server
sudo systemctl restart kea-dhcp4-server
sudo systemctl stop kea-dhcp4-server
sudo systemctl status kea-dhcp4-server
```

The `enable` and `disable` commands install and uninstall the kea dhcp4 service into the boot protocol, controlling whether the service is started automatically at boot time. The balance of the commands control or show information about the service.

&nbsp;

<details>
<summary>Mac</summary>

&nbsp;

On Mac OS, the DHCP service is provided by bootpd. The service is configured with a file named `/etc/bootpd.plist`. A sample configuration file is shown below. 

It is necessary to set the server ethernet interface to a static IP address for this configuration. It is recommended to manually set the Onvif GUI server ethernet address connecting to the camera network to be 10.1.1.1. This is a reserved network for private subnets. Please verify that your existing network does not use this address range. To make this configuration, use the Settings -> Network -> Ethernet -> TCP/IP -> Configure IPv4 -> Manually (combo box). The IP address should be set to `10.1.1.1`, the Subnet Mask to `255.255.255.0` and the Router to `10.1.1.1`. If you need internet access, you should have a second network connection to your local router, which is configured separately. Note that you may need to update network priorities in order to use the internet connected interface. Please refer to the section Network Priority on Multi Homed Hosts of this document.

This file is configured to use the interface named `en0`, which in most cases will be the ethernet interface on the Mac computer. Please check the name using the `ifconfig` command to verify that this is the correct information.

The service can then be started using the command

```
sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/bootps.plist
```

The service can be stopped with

```
sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/bootps.plist

<summary>Setting Up a Samba Share on Linux</summary>

&nbsp;

It is possible for Windows clients to access camera recordings residing on a Linux server on the local network by installing a samba share on the Linux server. There are a few steps needed to set up the server, which are often not well documented for this type of configuration. The following instructions will set up the shared folder on the server, then show how a Windows client can attach to the shared folder as a mapped drive. Please note that this setup is intended for use in a simple private network where all users can be trusted with data. More sophisticated configurations that control data access are possible, but are beyond the scope of these instructions.

* #### Linux Server Configuration

  <h3>Step 1. <b>Set Fixed IP Address</b></h3> The server should have a fixed IP address. This is not completely necessary for system operation, but will prevent mishaps later that can occur if the server address changes. For Ubuntu and similar systems, there is a GUI control dialog that can be used to assign a fixed IP address. The address chosen will depend on the router settings, which will set aside a range of addresses that are available for fixed IP. Usually this will be at the bottom and/or top of the IP range controlled by the router. The router setting that defines these ranges is set by DHCP. Check ahead of time that the desired IP address is not already taken and is available per the router configuration.

  <h3>Step 2. <b>Install and Configure Samba</b></h3> On Ubuntu, the Samba server is installed using the apt command

  ```
  sudo apt install samba
  ```

  The Samba configuration is performed by editing the `/etc/samba/smb.conf` file. The Samba installation will create a default file in this location, which is not a good fit for this type of configuration. It is recommnded to move the file to a backup and start with a fresh file for configuration, following the commands

  ```
  cd /etc/samba
  sudo mv smb.conf smb.conf.bak
  sudo nano smb.conf
  ```

  You will now be starting from a clean slate. The following text saved into the `smb.conf` file will create a sharing configuration that is compatible with the application. For this configuration, you will need to know the account under which Onvif GUI was installated. For example, if you created a user onvif-gui, and were logged on as that user during the time the appliation was installed, the default directory for the application will be /home/onvif-gui. The configuration shown below will share two sub-directories used by the program, namely Videos and Pictures.
  
  ```
  [global]
    workgroup = WORKGROUP

   [Videos]
    comment = Shared Videos Folder
    path = /home/onvif-gui/Videos
    browasble = yes
    read only = yes

  [Pictures]
    comment = Shared Pictures Folder
    path = /home/onvif-gui/Pictures
    browsable = yes
    read only = yes
  ```

  <h3>Step 3. Re-start the Samba service</h3> After changing the configuration file, it is necessary to re-start the service in order to enact the changes made. This should be done any time changes are made to the smb.conf file.

  ```
  sudo systemctl restart smbd
  ```
  
  <h3>Step 4. <b>Add User and Set Samba Password</b></h3>

  The command to add a user is

  ```
  sudo useradd -m <username>
  ```
  
  The samba access requires a passord for the user
    
  ```
  sudo smbpasswd -a <username>
  ```

  The system will prompt you to enter a password.

  ____________
  
  A script to get a list of active samba accounts

  ```
  #!/bin/bash

  # Run pdbedit and extract only the Unix usernames
  sudo pdbedit -L -v | while IFS= read -r line; do
    # Skip empty lines
    [[ -z "$line" ]] && continue

    # Match only lines that start with "Unix username:"
    if [[ "$line" == "Unix username:"* ]]; then
      value="${line#Unix username: }"
      echo "$value"
    fi
  done

  ```

  _____________


* #### Windows Client Configuration

  Open the file navigator in Windows and go to the Network section. Using the address bar at the top, enter the IP address of the server such as, for example,

  ```
  \\10.1.1.3
  ```

  If all goes well, you get a shared folder icon in the navigator. Double click the folder to get a login screen. Use the credentials of the Onvif GUI account on the Linux server. If successful, create a shared drive by right clicking over the folder and using the drop down menu, and make the drive persisent. Open the Ovnif GUI application, go to the Files tab and use the navigation bar at the top to select the Videos folder from the shared drive. You should see the folders holding the camera recordings.

* #### Linux Client Configuration

  Detailed configuration instructions can be found in the Operations -> Mount SMB Drive from Linux section of the notes.

<summary>Network Priority on Multi Homed Hosts</summary>

&nbsp;

---

When connecting a host computer to multiple networks, it may be difficult to reach remote computers if one of the connected networks does not have internet access. This can happen if the host computer uses the wired ethernet interface to isolate cameras on a network without internet access and the host intends to use the wireless connection to communicate with the internet. In this situation, the host operating system may attempt to use the wired ethernet connection to communicate with the internet which can result in lengthy delays or the inability to access the internet altogether.

The issue can be addressed by assigning priorities to network adapters. Most Linux distributions seem to be able to handle this situation on their own, so the issue is mostly associated with Windows and MacOS. The basic concept is to set the priority of the connection with the ability to access the internet a higher value than interfaces which are not connected to the internet.

### Windows

Open a powershell in Administrator mode and use the following command to show interface priorities

```
Get-NetIPInterface
```

This will show a table of the network interfaces and their associated priority. Interfaces are tagged with an identifier referred to as InterfaceIndex. The priority of the interface is referred to as InterfaceMetric where lower numbers have higher priority. The priority of an interface is set using the command

```
Set-NetIPInterface -InterfaceIndex <idx> -InterfaceMetric <metric>
```

Where `<idx>` is the network identifier number and `<metric>` is the priority

### MacOS

Click the Apple icon in the upper left corner of the screen and select System Settings -> Network. On the right on the dialog should be a drop down shown as `...v` with a question mark to the right. Click the drop down and select Set Service Order. You can then drag and drop the interface names to set the priority.

<summary>Python</summary>

&nbsp;

#### Introduction

Python configuration is critical to program operation. Part of the configuration involves the use of virtual environments, which may appear nebulous due to the abstract nature of the concept. Compounding the difficulty of developing an understanding of the mechanics of the implementation is the existence of several variations of Python tools that are capable of creating and managing virtual environments. The recommendation here is to focus on the original work from [python.org](https://python.org) and ignore other derivative products such as Anaconda and pyenv.

Python is a standard tool installed on every Linux distribution. Each Linux distro makes it's own version of Python, and it is often used to help manage shell scripts for system maintenance. Python has become quite popular and is now available on many other platforms. Python is not universally loved, however, and tales abound of Linux machines brought down by bad Python versions. This is a legitimate gripe as it is indeed possible to break the functionality of a system Python by overwriting its components with incompatible versions.

#### Virtual Environments

Virtual environments are a solution to the issue of system interaction with multiple Python installations. A virtual environment has two main components, the Folder and the Shell Variables.

* #### Folder

  A virtual environment Folder is a subdirectory on the disk containing all the files necessary to run a particular version of Python. This allows a Python version separate from the system installed version to operate independently. Python has been optimized to minimize the size of the Folder, so the virtual environments are lightwieght. The virtual environment Folder is created by a call to the venv module as ```python3 -m venv <name>```, where ```<name>``` is chosen by the user. Note that ```<name>``` is traditionally entered as a relative path name, but a full path name is valid. Note that some Linux distributions have the venv module included by default, while other distributions require the installation of additional libraries.

* #### Shell Variables

  An important feature of the virtual environment Folder is that it is not located on the system $PATH. This is done in order to minimize interaction with the system Python and other libraries. When virtual environments are activated, the shell in which Python executes has additional environment variables added to the inherited system environment variables. Python appears to other processes also operating within the shell that it is installed as the system Python. When the shell is closed, the shell variables do not persist. This is how the virtual environment prevents the interaction of the environment Python and the system Python. 
  
  Virtual enviroments are activated by calling the ```source <name>\bin\activate``` command. This opens a shell. The ```deactivate``` command closes the shell. During the time that the environment is active, the terminal prompt is changed to the environment name.

&nbsp;

The following commands create a virtual environment named after the caller supplied ```<name>``` and activate it. You should notice that the terminal prompt will now show the environment name set by ```<name>```. This is a visual cue indicating that the environment is active.

```
python3 -m venv <name>
source <name>/bin/activate
```

Python applications are then run in the virtual environment, for example ```python --version```. You may also observe the shell variables using the ```printenv``` commmand, which will show the virtual environment Folder at the front of the $PATH. The deactivate command closes the shell, and the terminal prompt will return to its original state.

```

```

It is worth noting at this point that Python on Linux is invoked by calling python3, which is a symbolic link to an executable file named after the system Python version e.g. python3.12. By using this strategy, multiple versions of Python can reside in the /usr/bin directory and coexist peacefully as long as the symlink python3 remains attached to the original system Python. If you want to invoke a particular Python version, just use the full python3.xx name of the executable. As a further note, virtual environments will have a symlink in their bin folder to the Python version that was used to create them, and the link is simply named python. The effect of this is that when a virtual environment is active, a call to python invokes the Python version used to create it.

#### Installing and Running Programs Written in Python

Virtual environments give developers the ability to build complex applications in a repeatable way without compromising system integrity. Independence from system libraries allows the use of localized versions of those libraries thereby avoiding problems with mismatched versions or missing system libraries. The Python installation helper, ```pip``` will install Python programs and packages into the virtual environment Folder, where any files needed to run the program are located as well.

When a program written in Python is installed in a virtual environment, a script is placed into the ```bin``` directory of the Folder. This script can be accessed directly from the system shell without activating the virtual environment. When called, the program script will activate its own shell and start the program. In this manner, a program written in Python can be started the same way as a binary compiled program, allowing integration into the system Applications folder with an icon for launching. Knowledge of the location of the virtual environment folder is required and the script is invoked using the full path name. 

#### Installing Python

Most if not all modern Linux systems have a recent system Python version installed by default. The system version of Python can be observed using the command

```
python3 --version
```

If the system Python version is at least 3.10, Onvif GUI can run directly on the system version. Onvif GUI can be run on older Linux versions with an upgraded Python version if the system kernel is at least 5.4 and the system Python is at least 3.8. The kernel version can be observed using the command

```
uname -r
```

The installation script will ask the user if they want to install an upgrade Python if the qualifications are met. The Python installation methods shown below are for reference.

Taken from this [link](https://serverfault.com/questions/1075408/can-i-have-my-kvm-guests-on-the-same-subnet-as-the-host)


The objective of this installation is that virtual machines share the same network as the host.

<h3>Set up the logical network bridge on the host</h3>

<b>Note that this configuration will disable the network interface from the host perspective. It is recommended to add a usb network adapter if you only have one ethernet interface (please refer to note at the bottom of this section</b>

Create `/etc/netplan/01-kvmbridge.yaml`. Example:

```
network:
  ethernets:
    enp4s0:
      dhcp4: true
  bridges:
    virbr0:
      interfaces: [enp4s0]
      dhcp4: true
      mtu: 1500
      parameters:
        stp: true
        forward-delay: 15
```

Notes: NIC name will differ depending on driver. Address assignment doesn't have to be by DHCP.

Run `sudo netplan try` to test the config and `sudo netplan apply` to apply it once you're satisfied it works. Note that changing a network config over ssh may not be a good idea.

</h3>Tell KVM how to access the connection</h3>

Create a file `~/kvmbridge.xml` with the following contents:

```
<network>
  <name>host-bridge</name>
  <forward mode="bridge"/>
  <bridge name="virbr0"/>
</network>
```

<h3>Enable the bridge</h3>

```
virsh net-define ~/kvmbridge.xml
virsh net-start host-bridge
virsh net-autostart host-bridge
```

You should now be able to select the network host-bridge for your VMs to have them coexist on the same network as the host. Use the blue i dot to access the hardware and set the NIC to host-bridge network.

It was observed over time that the secondary usb network adapter was no longer necessary and the QEMU seemed to be sharing the single network adapter with the host, which is the desired result. It is possible that re-booting implements this functionality, or it is also possible that seemingly unrelated installations occured which may have been the cause. Unknown at this time.

The instructions do not include the installation of the virt network manager. I believe it is common knowledge, with out tricky setup. I did first install the QuickGUI version of QEMU, which is not recommended.

&nbsp;

Derived from this [link](https://blog.sergeantbiggs.net/posts/file-sharing-with-qemu-and-virt-manager/), which has further untested instructions for windows.

```
sudo apt install virtiofsd
mkdir ~/dist
```


<b><u>Virtiofs needs shared memory to work</u></b>. This can be enabled in the hardware configuration window. Navigate to Hardware -> Memory and select Enable shared memory, then click the Apply button.

After that, open virt-manager and select the virtual machine while it is not running. Click the Open Icon, and then click the blue circle i button. The virt-manager hardware window will be shown. The left pane contains the different categories. The right pane contains the setting for the specific category. Beneath the categorey pane, there is a button called 'Add Hardware'. A dialog box should pop up. In the pane on the left, click on Filesystem.

<h3>Filesystem options</h3>

The settings are as follows:

For the Driver, we keep the default (virtiofs). The source path is the path on our host filesystem. The target path is a bit of a misnomer. It’s not actually a path, just an identifier that we use as a mount point in our guest file system. This will become clear when we mount the file system in the guest later.

If you want a more detailed overview of these options and some alternatives, check out the libvirt knowledge base on virtiofs

<h3>Guest Configuration</h3>

After that, it’s time to configure the guest. First we create a folder in our users home directory that we will mount the share into.

```
mkdir ~/dist
```

After that, we can mount the share with:

```
sudo mount -t virtiofs dist /home/stephen/dist
```

If we want to make this permanent, we can just add an entry to /etc/fstab

```
dist   /home/stephen/dist       virtiofs        defaults        0       0
```

After rebooting, the share should be mounted! If your user on the host and the guest are the same, you don’t even need to worry about any other permissions. Otherwise, change the folder with chmod to suit your needs.

<details><summary>Install Docker on Linux</summary>

&nbsp;

These instructions are for a simple installation on a clean system of recent vintage. If you are working on a legacy system, upgrading an existing Docker installation or have other special considerations, please refer to the [official Docker instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install). Please note that there are a number of unofficial Docker packages that do not have proper hardware interface and will not work with Onvif GUI. A recent official Docker package is required for proper operation. 

Please note that if you have an NVIDIA GPU, the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html) must be installed on top of Docker. You should be aware that the Toolkit has a number of associated bugs that you may encounter. Most of these bugs are well known and you will find many references and suggested fixes of various quality that you can try to get the card operational in a Docker container. Please make sure that you are able to run the [sample workload](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/sample-workload.html) after installing the toolkit. It may be necessary to adjust the Docker run scripts based on the results of troubleshooting efforts on the toolkit.

Step 0. Remove Existing Packages

<b>Important</b> Some distributions may include unofficial Docker packages. These unoffical packages are unlikely to work with Onvif GUI due to the lack of proper display server protocol handling. Run the following command to uninstall if necessary.

```
for pkg in docker.io docker-doc docker-compose docker-compose-v2 podman-docker containerd runc; do sudo apt-get remove $pkg; done
```

Step 1. Setup Docker <b>apt</b> repository.

```
# Add Docker's official GPG key:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "${UBUNTU_CODENAME:-$VERSION_CODENAME}") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
```

Step 2. Install the Docker packages.

```
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

Step 3. Start the Docker service 

```
sudo service docker start
```

Step 4. Configure Rootless Mode

```
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

Step 5. Test Installation

```
docker run hello-world
```

</details>

<details><summary>Fedora</summary>

&nbsp;

Step 0. Remove Existing Packages

<b>Important</b>  Onvif GUI requires a current official Docker version for operation. If an older or unofficial Docker version is installed, the following error messages may be observed when trying to run the onvif-gui Docker container. 

```
qt.qpa.xcb: could not connect to display :0
qt.qpa.plugin: From 6.5.0, xcb-cursor0 or libxcb-cursor0 is needed to load the Qt xcb platform plugin.
qt.qpa.plugin: Could not load the Qt platform plugin "xcb" in "" even though it was found.
This application failed to start because no Qt platform plugin could be initialized. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.

Available platform plugins are: eglfs, linuxfb, minimal, minimalegl, offscreen, vkkhrdisplay, vnc, wayland-egl, wayland, xcb.
```
The current Docker installation can be viewed using the command 

```
dnf list | grep docker
```

If this is the case, it is necessary to remove the existing Docker installation and install the current official Docker version. To do this, run the following command to uninstall the default Fedora docker version if necessary.

```
sudo dnf remove docker*
```

Step 1. Setup the Repository

```
sudo dnf -y install dnf-plugins-core
sudo dnf-3 config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/fedora/docker-ce.repo
```

Step 2. Install Docker Engine

```
sudo dnf install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

Step 3. Start Docker Engine

```
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
```

Step 4. Configure Rootless Mode

```
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

Step 5. Test Installation

```
docker run hello-world
```

<summary>Operations</summary>

<details>
<summary>Linux Installation Script</summary>

&nbsp;

To install the program on Linux, an installation script has been developed. The basic concept of the script is to make sure that a valid version of python exists on the target machine, create a virtual environment, install onvif-gui, then create a desktop icon in the Applications folder. A design goal of the script is to have as minimal an impact on the target operating evironment as possible. The install script requires sudo privileges, so it will ask the user to type in the password.

Because the script is intended to work for an arbitrary Linux distribution, it first must ascertain the package manager. Three managers are supported, those being apt, dnf and pacman. The type of package manager is determined by attempting to run a list command for each package type and the first one that succeeds is used. If the package manager is determined to be apt, the update command is run. This is necessary due to the need for current libraries for some portions of the installation. This practice is considered non-impactful as the apt update operation only updates the version pointers in the database and does not change any installed libraries. Package managers dnf and pacman are not updated in this manner as they will actually change existing configuration, and this was not observed to be necessary anyway for program installation.

The install script will then look for a valid Python version, which needs to be at least 3.10. If the Python version is less than 3.10, the script will ask the user if they would like the script to install Python version 3.12. This script will work in many cases, but will require some minimum versions of libraries, which if not present, will cause the failure of the script. It has been observed that the script running on Linux versions with Python 3.8 and greater will succeed. The script installed Python will not interfere with the system installed Python. This is effect is made possible by the use of the ```make altinstall``` procedure which will place the newly compiled Python version in the system libraries under it's own name, which is not included in the system environment variables or symbolic links. The system Python will continue to operate as before, without any interference from the newly compiled version. 

If a valid Python version has been found, the script will now create a virtual environment for the program. In some cases, notably under apt, a python-venv module will require installation. The script will check for the existence of this module and install it if necessary. The virtual environment will be named ```onvif-gui-env``` and will be placed in the user's ```$HOME/.local/share``` directory.

Once the virtual environment has been set up, the script will source the environment and install onvif-gui. The script will then check for the use of the X11 desktop protocol. If this is being used, the script will install a minimum required configuration for the protcol. This is mostly relevant to apt as distributions using the other package managers generally include the X11 drivers by default.

The script will then check for the existence of GPU and associated drivers. For NVIDIA drivers the script will attempt to run the ```nvidia-smi``` command. The target computer will have to have the drivers installed prior to running the script in order for it to succeed. As most modern Linux distributions include these drivers as part of the installation process, it should be there already if the system was properly installed. The script will then check for Intel iGPU and will ask for permission to install those drivers. Intel NPU is checked as well, but unfortunately, those drivers are only available on a limited subset of Ubuntu.

Finally, the script installs an icon in the system Applications folder for starting the program. The program can be started by clicking the icon.

<details>
<summary>Running Multiple Cameras</summary>

&nbsp;

Performance in a multi camera configuration can be improved by using substreams. Most cameras are capable of running two streams simultaneously which are configured independently. The default stream is called the Main Stream and has higher resolution, bitrate and frame rate. The Sub Stream is an alternate stream and will have lower resolution, bitrate and frame rate. The Sub Stream is more easily decoded, processed and displayed and can be thought of as a view finder for the Main Stream. 

The application uses the generic terms Display Profile and Record Profile for streams that are processed. The Display Profile is shown to the user in the application and is set on the Media tab for the camera. Note that the default Display Profile will be the higher resolution Main Stream. The Record Profile is used by the application for saving the camera output to disk and is selected on the camera System tab. The Record Profile is not decoded so it places very little compute load on the application and can be used to record high resolution streams without affecting system performance. If the Display Profile and Record Profile are matched, only that one stream is processed by the application.

When running multiple cameras through the system, it is recommended to use the camera sub streams at a low resolution and frame rate to be the Display Profiles. If a more detailed view of the camera stream is needed, the application has a feature that will allow users to view the higher resolution stream by double clicking on the camera stream of interest in the display. This feature will pop out a new window showing the stream.

Stream analytics are performed on the Display stream. The amount of compute load placed on the system during analysis is directly related to Display stream resolution and frame rate, so substreams are strongly recommended if running analytics. 

Many camera substreams will have a distorted aspect ratio, which can be corrected by using the Aspect combo box of the Camera Panel Media Tab.

&nbsp;

---

</details>

<details>
<summary>Performance Tuning</summary>

&nbsp;

As the number of cameras and stream analytics added to the system increases, the host may become overwhelmed, causing cache buffer overflow resulting in dropped frames. If a camera stream is dropping frames, a yellow border will be displayed over the camera output. The load placed on the system by the cameras can be reduced by lowering frame rates and resolutions.

Compute load may also be reduced by increasing the Display Refresh Interval on the General Tab of the Settings section. Camera video streams are buffered and stitched together to form the composite display which is shown once per the interval as set by a timer. Depending on the frame rate of the cameras, this setting can be increased without significant data loss if the Display Refresh Interval is smaller than the inverse of the camera frame rate. This effect is most prominently observed on Windows.

The load on the computer can be observed using a system monitoring tool such as Task Manager on Windows. This tool can be launched by right clicking over the task bar. Linux has a nice monitoring tool named [Mission Center](https://flathub.org/apps/io.missioncenter.MissionCenter) that has an appearance very similar to Task Manager. Apple Macs have the Activity Monitor with pop out windows for CPU and GPU history that can be accessed from the Mac toolbar.

When setting up the computer for Onvif GUI, it can be helpful to observe the effects of different operations on the system load using the appropriate monitoring tool. Pushing the computer too hard will reduce reliability over time and may lead to crashing. It is a good idea to observe the loads on individual cores in the CPU and try to avoid bottlenecks caused when a single core becomes saturated and is flat lined at 100% usage. GPUs likewise will start to misbehave if pushed too hard. It is a good idea to leave some headroom in the performance metrics to allow for system operations that are performed periodically by the computer in the background.

Lower powered CPUs with a small number of cores or systems running a large number of streams may benefit from hardware decoding. More powerful CPUs with a large core count will work as well as a hardware decoder for smaller numbers of streams.

Stream analysis can potentially place significant burden on system resources. A GPU or iGPU is recommended for YOLO analysis, as a CPU only system will be able to process maybe one or two streams at the most. NVIDIA graphics cards provide the highest performance, and Intel Xe Graphics or later is recommended for iGPU. Modern Macs with Apple Silicon M series chips are capable of performing YOLO analysis. Using Skip Frames during YOLO analysis can also greatly reduce compute load. Using substreams for analysis is recommended, ideally matching the model size parameter to the stream resolution, which by default is 640.

Software developments in this field are constantly advancing, so it may be worthwhile to research new versions of libraries such as pytorch, openvino and associated graphics hardware drivers to see if new performance improvements are available.

<details>
<summary>Camera Compliance With Standards</summary>

&nbsp;

Camera compliance with the onvif standard is often incomplete and in some cases incorrect. Success may be limited in many cases. Cameras made by Hikvision or Dahua will have the greatest level of compatibility. Note that some third party OEM vendors who sell branded versions of these cameras might significantly alter the functionality of the camera software.

Camera settings on the Media tab are most likely to work. Other tabs may have limited success. If Onvif GUI is able to determine that the camera settings for a particular function are unavailable, it will disable the controls for that function.

If the camera DHCP setting is properly onvif compliant, the IP address may be reliably set. Some cameras may not respond to the DHCP setting requested by onvif-gui due to non compliance. Note that the camera may reboot automatically under some conditions if the DHCP setting is changed from off to on. DHCP must be turned off before setting a static IP address.

If there is an issue with a particular setting, it is recommended to connect to the camera with a web browser, as most cameras will have a web interface that will allow you to make the changes reliably. onvif-gui has a button on the Camera Panel System Tab that will launch the web browser connection with the camera.

<details>
<summary>Troubleshooting Techniques</summary>

&nbsp;

If you are having difficulty installing or running the program, this first place to check is the program logs. The program maintains a log of most important system functions that can be accessed from the Settings -> General tab. Browsing through the messages may produce some insight into root causes for some issues.

Running the program from the command line inside the virutal environment can help find issues as they occur during operation. To open the virtual environment, use the appropriate command from the list below.

  * Linux

  ```
  source $HOME/.local/share/onvif-gui-env/bin/activate
  ```

  * Mac

  ```
  source /Applications/OnvifGUI.app/Contents/MacOS/Python/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/onvif-gui-env/bin/activate
  ```

  * Windows

  ```
  %HOMEPATH%\onvif-gui-env\Scripts\activate
  ```

  Once inside the virtual environment, the prompt will change to (onvif-gui-env) and the program can be started with the command

  ```onvif-gui```

The teminal will now show messages in real time as they occur during program operation.

Opening an Issue in the github repository is encouraged for issues you are not able to resolve on your own. Often times, issues may exist that are unkown to the developers, and feedback is necessary to raise awareness. There are a number of common problems that have been addressed in the Issues, so a look though those may help discover a solution.

Existing issues may have been addressed with a new release of the application, so check that you are using the latest version. The version of the application is displayed in the title bar of the program window. If you want to update, first start the virtual environment as shown above and use the command `pip install --upgrade onvif-gui`.

</details>

<details><summary>Application Icon on Linux</summary>

&nbsp;

---
An icon launcher can improve usability for the application, especially for non-technical users. On Linux, the desktop icons are configured with .desktop files, which can reside either in the users `$HOME/.local/share/applications` folder, or in the system `/usr/share/applications` folder. Launchers placed in the system location will require sudo access to install. 

A typical .desktop file is shown below. This file was written for a bare metal install of the program in a python virtual environment. It is possible to create an icon for a Docker installation of the application, in which case the Terminal field should be set to true, and the Exec should point to the Docker launch script.

```
[Desktop Entry]
Version=2.5.2
Name=Onvif GUI
Comment=Camera Manager
Exec=/home/stephen/onvif-gui-env/bin/onvif-gui
Terminal=false
Icon=/home/stephen/onvif-gui-env/lib/python3.12/site-packages/onvif_gui/resources/onvif-gui.png
StartupWMClass=python3
Type=Application
Categories=Utility
```

For the most part, the fields are self-explanatory. It is common, however, for the laucher to fail without any feedback, which can make troubleshooting difficult. Typical reasons for failure is the lack of an executable flag on the .desktop file. This can be fixed by using the file browser to navigate to the .desktop file, and right clicking to find the properties and setting the executable flag. You might also be able to accomplish the same with the terminal by chmod +x on the file. Another reason for failure may be an incorrect path setting for the Exec or Icon. A tool that can be used to help is `desktop-file-validate <file.desktop>` which will produce some diagnostics of varying quality.

It may be necessary, particularly on older systems, to reboot the computer after changes are made to the .desktop file in order to observe the effect of the changes.

There is one problem that is more difficult to solve with a GUI program and that is the StartupWMClass. The solution to this issue will vary based on whether the application is running in X11 or Wayland. The basic strategy is to start the application running, and then in another terminal, start a diagnostic program that will determine the possible setting to StartupWMClass based on the application characteristic, then adjust the .desktop field accordingly.

For X11, the procedure is to start the application, then open another terminal, in which the command `xprop WM_CLASS` is entered. At this point, the cursor will become a cross, and if clicked over a running application, will produce a message in the terminal. This message or some close variation can then be used in the .desktop file to the StartupWMClass.

If you are operating in Wayland, use the Keystroke combination ALT + F2 to start a dialog box. In the box, type `lg`. This will produce a diagnostic similar to the X11 output, but will show for all open windows. You will need to record the `wmclass` field for the application of interest, which can then be entered into the .dekstop file. Use the ESCAPE key to close the dialog.

It has been observed that older systems prefer the StartupWMClass=onvif-gui and newer ones work with StartupWMClass=python3.

The default window server can be seen by running `echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE`

The application will default to the window server in this variable. This will work best on most systems. If for some reason, you need to run on a particular server which is diffent that the default, set the environment variable 

```
export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland 
```
before starting the application. You can set this variable to be persistent by editing the configuration file `~./profile`. Please note that the Wayland server does not allow windows to position themselves when starting. The effect of this is that the application window and error message dialogs will always appear in the upper left of the screen when starting.

It has been observed that the application running X11 forced by this environment variable on and Ubuntu 24.04 with wayland as the default driver would crash when the screen saver set in.

There are a few different paths you can take during this process, so some of the steps below may be redundant. If you click around enough, you should be able to get it working.

The First step is to turn on windows sharing
* Settings -> Network & Internet -> Sharing
* Under Private ensure that both "Turn on Network Discovery: and "Turn on file and printer sharing" are toggled on

Share a folder
* Use the file explorer to find the folder you want to share
* Right click over the folder
* Properties -> Sharing -> Advanced Sharing
* Give access to users with the dropdown box
* You can create a new account from the dropdown

Create an account for the external machines to use when mounting the shared folder
* Settings -> Accounts -> Other Users --> Add Account
* Unfortunately, Microsoft will try to make this a Microsoft account, so you have to click through a couple screens to get to a local acccount
  * I don't have this person's sign-on information
  * Add a user without a Microsoft Account
* Type in a user name, password and hints, which are required

Add User to Shared Folder
* Use the file explorer and right click over the folder to be shared
* Show More Options -> Give access to -> Specific People
* Select the User name from the dropdown box
* Click Add
* When asked if you want to change folder settings say yes (twice)

You should now be able to sign into the folder from an SMB client with the user credentials

Create a Mount Point. Please note that if you installed the application by snap or flatpak, you will not have access to the /mnt directory. The installers create a container environment that limits your access to directories on the host. In this case, you should create another mount point that is accessible from within the application container. 

The application containers only allow connection to Videos and Pictures directories on the host. In this case, the easiest option is to create subdirectories in your Videos and Pictures folders. The mounting process will obscure files on the host system in favor of files on the mounted remote. If you have existing files in the Videos or Pictures folders, or if you need to preserve the location for use by other programs, using subdirectories as the mounting points will let you keep using the Videos and Pictures folders without disrupting other programs.

The examples that follow are based on general mounting instructions, and use the generic tag `<mount_point>` to indicate the mount directory. Note that the best practice is to use the full path name of the mount point directory in the following commands.

```
sudo mkdir -p <mount_point>
```

Mount the share, you can get the uid and gid using the command `id $USER`
```
sudo mount -t cifs //<server_ip>/<share_path> <mount_point> -o username=<username>,password=<password>,uid=<user_id>,gid=<group_id>
```

Once you are done testing the mount, you can unmount the remote server before setting it up permanently
```
umount <mount_point>
```

If you are having trouble finding the share, you can use the smb client to query the server
```
smbclient -L <server_address>
```

For better security, you should use a credentials file
```
sudo nano /root/.smbcredentials

username=<username>
password=<password>
domain=<domain> (if applicable)

sudo chmod 600 /root/.smbcredentials

sudo mount -t cifs //<server_ip>/<share_path> <mount_point> -o credentials=/root/.smbcredentials,uid=<user_id>,gid=<group_id>

```

To make the mount persistent, edit the fstab file
```
sudo nano /etc/fstab

//<server_ip>/<share_path> <mount_point> cifs x-systemd.automount,_netdev,credentials=/root/.smbcredentials,uid=<user_id>,gid=<group_id> 0 0
```

You can test the fstab file
```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo mount -a
```

Please note that the mount requires the system to wait for the network to be up before running fstab. The part of the fstab entry - `x-systemd.automount,_netdev,` is what does this. It assumes you have systemd in you Linux distribution. If you don't know what systemd is, you probably have it, as most mainstream linux distros use it by default. If you are using a distro that doesn't have it, then you probably already know what to do.

Once the mount is established, you can use the directory browser from the Files panel to set the Video directory used by the application. Note that the Files panel setting is used for viewing existing videos. The setting on the Storage panel Archive Dir is used by the application for writing videos files as they are produced by the cameras.

<summary>Updating the Repository</summary>

&nbsp;

The libonvif git repository includes three python modules, ```libonvif```, ```libavio```, and ```kankakee``` in addition to the main ```onvif-gui``` module. These modules can be installed to a user machine from the pypi server or locally by using the pip command on the .whl files which have been created previously using the ```python -m build``` command for each repository. The official instructions for this process can be found on the [Python web site](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/).

There are scripts for each operating system that will compile and assemble the modules for deployment on the PyPi server. The scripts are intended to be run on virtual machines and are designed to run on a freshly installed vm such that no configuration of the vm is required other than installation.

Version control is critical in the update process and requires edits in several locations that should be coordinated carefully. The following git submodules are included and require similar updates to version number. The version update should be performed and tested on the development git server, then uploaded to the pypi server and tested from there. Ultimately, the changes are migrated to the github repository following the migration instructions in this document.

<h3>kankakee</h3>

  * CMakeLists.txt
  * pyproject.toml
  * setup.py
  * src/kankakee.cpp

<h3>libavio</h3>

  * CMakeLists.txt
  * pyproject.toml
  * setup.py
  * src/avio.cpp

<h3>libonvif</h3>

  * CMakeLists.txt
  * pyproject.toml
  * setup.py
  * src/onvif.cpp

Version control for the onvif-gui module is different, as it is the main module of the onvif-gui program, and will reference the versions of the submodules listed above the pyproject.toml file.

<h3>onvif-gui</h3>

  * pyproject.toml (Including the onvif-gui version <u>AND</u> the dependencies section)
  * setup.py
  * gui/main.py

<h3>flatpak</h3>

  * io.github.sr99622.OnvifGUI.yml (onvif_gui whl from pypi)
  * io.github.sr99622.OnvifGUI.metainfo.xml (release version)

<h3>snap</h3>

  * snapcraft.yaml

<h3>mac</h3>

  * <i>implicit in the onvif-gui whl</i>

<h3>windows</h3>

  * onvif-gui.nsi (!VERSIONMAJOR  !VERSIONMINOR  !VERSIONBUILD)

After making these changes, commit the respective directories as follows, assuming a start from the main libonvif directory. Please note that the git repository structure is not symmetric with respect to the placement of the libonvif python module in the main repository, rather than a separate git submodule as the others.

```
cd kankakee
git commit -a
git push

cd ../libavio
git commit -a
git push

cd ..
git commit -a
git push
```

The build scripts can be found in the libonvif source tree at assets/scripts. ```linux_build```, ```mac_build```, and ```windows_build.bat``` are the names of the scripts. The scripts are intended to be run on virtual machines. For Linux and Windows, QEMU will create the proper vm. Mac OS vms can be built with UTM virtual machine manager on Apple Silicon. Put the appropriate script in the home directory for each platform and execute. The script will pull the latest version of the source code and build the python binary installs. The linux_build script should be run on a vm with Linux Mint 20 installed. The binary installs produced will work with any Linux kernel greater than 5.4. The mac_build script can be run on the latest Mac OS, and will produce binary installs for that particular OS version. A Windows vm is most easily built using Windows 11 and the windows_build.bat will produce binary installs that will work for most modern Windows versions. 

The finshed python installs will be collected in the libonvif/dist directory and can be uploaded to PyPi from there. Testing the installs should be done for each python version. The ffmpeg_build and libxml2_build directories in the home directory should be removed to insure that the relocatable linking has been performed correctly when running the test.

<summary>Migration from dev to remote git server</summary>

Set up a directory named `migrate` with two subdirectories `local` and `remote`. Clone without recursion the three libraries (kankakee, libavio, libonvif) separately into their respective subdirectory, local and remote. Using git rm, remove pybind11 from the respective submodules. Also git rm the kankakee and libavio submodules from the root libonvif directory. This is done for both the local and remote repository collections.

```
cd migrate/remote

git clone https://github.com/sr99622/kankakee
cd kankakee
git rm pybind11
git commit -a

cd ..
git clone https://github.com/sr99622/libavio
cd libavio
git rm pybind11
git commit -a

cd ..
git clone https://github.com/sr99622/libonvif
cd libonvif/libonvif
git rm pybind11
cd ..
git rm kankakee
git rm libavio
git commit -a

<repeat for migrate/local>
...

```

Now delete the `local` .git directory and replace with the `remote` .git directory. The local repository is now the base configuration for the remote.  Add the submodules back into the repository. If any new files were added into any of the repositories, it will be necessary to git add them. Finally, commit and push.

```
cd migrate/local

cd kankakee
sudo rm -R .git
cp -R ../../remote/kankakee/.git .
git submodule add https://github.com/pybind/pybind11
git add --all
git commit -a
git push

cd ../libavio
sudo rm -R .git
cp -R ../../remote/libavio/.git .
git submodule add https://github.com/pybind/pybind11
git add --all
git commit -a
git push

cd ../libonvif
sudo rm -R .git
cp -R ../../remote/libonvif/.git .
cd libonvif
git submodule add https://github.com/pybind/pybind11

TLDR;

Use Finder to move existing /Applications/OnvifGUI to the trash, then run

```
cd $HOME/libonvif
git pull
assets/scripts/components/mac/build_app
```

When finished, launch DMG Canvas and open the OnvifGUI.dmg file from Recent Files. Start by clicking the hammer icon. The installer file will be

```
$HOME/assets/scripts/components/mac/OnvifGUI.dmg
```

Rename it to OnvifGUI-x.y.z.dmg where x.y.z is the version number.

----------

Background Info

The script build_app in the assets/scripts/components/mac folder is used to build the MacOS installer DMG. The script relies on homebrew and will install it as the first action along with a few tools needed for compilation. The basic theory behind the installer is that a python virtual environment is built within the /Applications/OnvifGUI.app folder under the premise that this will be the location for any arbitrary installation. This is a critical assumption, as the location of the onvif-gui executable script is required for launching. Any exisiting OnvifGUI folder in the Applications folder should be removed prior to starting the build.

Once the app has been assembled in situ, the [DMG Canvas application](https://www.araelium.com/dmgcanvas) is used to build the DMG file and notarize it on the Apple Developer site. A valid developer subscription and certificate are required for this operation. It may also be necessary to have an app-specific password in the Keychain for the developer machine, although it is unclear if this is actually required. It is important to note that the app should not be launched from the build location after compile but prior to notarization, as artifacts created in the folder will invalidate the codesign. It has also been observed that running the DMG Canvas application twice in a row will fail the notarization the second time. A reboot has been found to avoid this problem.

 A good resource for understanding the app building process can be found at this [link](https://blog.xojo.com/2024/08/22/macos-apps-from-sandboxing-to-notarization-the-basics/)

<summary>App Installer for Flatpak</summary>

&nbsp;

---

The script to build a flatpak can be found in the assets/scripts/components/flatpak folder. There is code for building the flatpak using either onvif-gui from PyPi or from a local file. If a local file is selected, you need to build it first using `python -m build` from the libonvif/onvif-gui folder then copy the whl file from the dist subdirectory to the flatpak folder.

To install flatpak-builder

```
sudo dnf install flatpak-builder
```

Flatpak needs to know the location of the Flathub repository. Because the flatpak will be built using the --user flag, you must also apply this flag when adding the remote repository.

```
flatpak remote-add --user --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
```

You can list available remotes.

```
flatpak remotes
```

The flatpak can be built and installed using the following command. To build without installing, remove the `--install` flag.

```
flatpak-builder --force-clean --user --install-deps-from=flathub --repo=repo --install builddir $HOME/libonvif/assets/scripts/components/linux/flatpak/io.github.sr99622.OnvifGUI.yml
```

While the application is installed, a command prompt can run the container environment.

```
flatpak run --command=sh io.github.sr99622.OnvifGUI
```

To uninstall the application, use the command.

```
flatpak uninstall io.github.sr99622.OnvifGUI
```

To build a single file flatpak installer, run the command (this will take a while to run).

```
flatpak build-bundle repo OnvifGUI.flatpak io.github.sr99622.OnvifGUI
```

This can then be used to install the application.

```
sudo flatpak install OnvifGUI.flatpak
```

<summary>App Installer for snap</summary>

&nbsp;

---

The script for building a snap is in the libonvif/assets/scripts/components/linux/snap folder. The commands to build the snap should be run from the parent of the snap folder i.e. libonvif/assets/scripts/components/linux. 

The first thing you need to do is to install snapcraft

```
sudo snap install snapcraft --classic
```

Then you have to [install and configure LXD](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/lxd/latest/tutorial/first_steps/#first-steps), permissions should do it. A reboot is needed to complete.

```
sudo snap install lxd
sudo usermod -aG lxd "$USER"
newgrp lxd
lxd init --minimal
sudo reboot now
```

To build the package, use the command from the directory which is the parent of the snap directory containing snapcraft.yaml

```
snapcraft
```

There will be a large volume of error messages and such. Most can be ignored, but some may be relavant. If it doesn't work, then you can comb through the messages and look for things. If it does work, it's fine. You can run the command as `snapcraft --debug` flag to drop into a shell if the process fails.

Sometimes, the system will cache parts of the build that can cause actual errors, to clean the cache

```
snapcraft clean
```

To install the package

```
sudo snap install onvif-gui*snap --dangerous
```

To get audio working, you should be on pulse audio (which is the default). From the terminal, run the command

```
sudo snap connect onvif-gui:pulseaudio
```

To uninstall

```
sudo snap remove onvif-gui
```


The yaml configuration file includes code for installing the NPU driver, which requires separate installation. 

```
sudo snap install intel-npu-driver
sudo chown root:render /dev/accel/accel0
sudo chmod g+rw /dev/accel/accel0
sudo usermod -a -G render $USER
sudo bash -c "echo 'SUBSYSTEM==\"accel\", KERNEL==\"accel*\", GROUP=\"render\", MODE=\"0660\"' > /etc/udev/rules.d/10-intel-vpu.rules"
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger --subsystem-match=accel
sudo reboot now
```

If it's not working, you can start a shell prompt to look around

```
snap run --shell onvif-gui
```

<summary>App Installer for Windows</summary>

&nbsp;

---

There is a script that will handle most of the work for a windows installer build. ** Note ** the installer must be run from a command prompt with Administrator Privilege. The installer uses the NSIS program to build and the script will check if that is installed on the machine and download it if necessary. The basic concept for the installer is similar MacOS, in that the onvif-gui-env virtual environment is created in a known location that will be common across machines, in this case, C:\Program Files (x86). There is a chance that this strategy will fail if the user has configured the OS to run from another drive such as D:, Oh Well. 

The onvif-gui.nsi file is fed into the NSIS script reader. There is some prep work to do before the script is run, edit the onvif-gui.nsi file at the top to set the current version number. The script will set up a directory at %HOMEPATH%\installer and copy some configuration files and run from there. To run the script

```
%HOMEPATH%\libonvif\assets\scripts\components\windows\installer\build_installer.bat
```

The result is an executable file in the %HOMEPATH%\installer directory named OnvifGUI-installer-x.x.x.exe, where x.x.x is the version triplet. Just double click to install. There will be a warning sign that the developer is unkown. To uninstall, go to the settings panel and look through the installed apps.

<summary>Vectorize Windows Icon</summary>

&nbsp;

courtesy of [thebunnyrules](https://superuser.com/users/529932/thebunnyrules)

Open said png in Gimp. Your going to make an image with several layers. When you finish each layer is going to be a different size in the finished icon. Here's the layer layout I usually use 256px (optional), 128px, 96px, 64px, 48px, 40px,32px and 24px. You want to have this diversity in sizes because you need to account for all the different zooms the user will have while browsing in explorer. 256 is overkill but why not future proof your icon?

Step 1: import png into gimp. I usually do this by using Open With in windows on the png and selecting gimp. Gimp will do the rest after that. make sure it's the only layer at the moment (delete any background layers if gimp made any).

Step 2: Resize picture to 256x256 (or 128x128 if you don't want to use 256) by clicking the Image menu and selecting Scale Image. If the image you're stating with isn't square, you'll have to crop it before doing the scaling or it will look weird. You can crop by using rectangle select tool (make sure you do a square selection by pressing shift while selecting). When you're done selecting, click on Image menu and select Crop to Selection.

Step 3: Duplicate current layer by selecting the Layer menu and selecting Duplicate Layer. Click Layer menu again and select Scale Layer and resize duplicated layer to new size like 128 or 96 etc.

Step 4: rinse and repeat until you have made your layers all the way to 24px.

step 5: export current drawing as an Icon by clicking on File menu and selecting Export As. When you get the dialog prompt, you want to make sure that you put in the correct extension (.Ico) and gimp will handle the rest.

## In memory of Dr. Jian Sun
Without the guidance of [Dr. Sun Jian](http://www.jiansun.org/), YOLOX would not have been released and open sourced to the community.
The passing away of Dr. Sun Jian is a great loss to the Computer Vision field. We have added this section here to express our remembrance and condolences to our captain Dr. Sun.
It is hoped that every AI practitioner in the world will stick to the concept of "continuous innovation to expand cognitive boundaries, and extraordinary technology to achieve product value" and move forward all the way.

<div align="center"><image src="assets/images/sunjian.png" width="200"></div>
没有孙剑博士的指导，YOLOX也不会问世并开源给社区使用。
孙剑博士的离去是CV领域的一大损失，我们在此特别添加了这个部分来表达对我们的“船长”孙老师的纪念和哀思。
希望世界上的每个AI从业者秉持着“持续创新拓展认知边界，非凡科技成就产品价值”的观念，一路向前。
